## Recruiter AGM

Recruiter is an git testing application. Download at you own risk :)

## Installing Recruiter

This is all trial for now, so before you try to install, organize your machine. Download and install composer.

- Clone or download the repository (local server)
- in the root folder copy .env.example and rename it .env
- in .env connect it to the database
- in your terminal, get to root folder of the repository
- type 'composer install'
- type 'php artisan serve' and go to the shown url

It should work, but... nothing is certain.
